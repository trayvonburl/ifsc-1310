<h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p> Progressive Enhancement is important because it allows content to be the primary focus. It also helps with keeping your browser updated as time progresses as well, making the website less faulty. Progressive Enhancement allows for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to run smoothly together, making it easier to update and modify the website. Understanding this allows for the user to be competent and knowledgeable of the graceful degradation and the idea of layering in web development. It also helps with the site's load time too if the site is regularly updated.

<h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
      <p>My sister told me that I needed to put more thought and effort into the project, but she liked how the project was cohesive. In the first draft I just had 2 paragraphs and a background image. It took me a while to find the right color scheme and the fonts to use. After the first draft, I added 4 more images to make the site more appealing. If I were to start over, I would not procrastinate as I did and I would probaby choose the other project for fun. During this semester, I enjoyed using Corel Vector the most as we used the application to create the Bear on the Moon and the Corel Vector logo. I enjoyed learning the behind the scenes of UALR's website as the class got to see that there is a lot that goes on behind images and websites. I started off the year well before the midterm, but I began to let the assignemnts slip as I started to work full time. If I were to change anything, I definitely would've stayed part-time as I could've been more interactive in the class.
