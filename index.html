<h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p> Progressive Enhancement is important because it allows content to be the primary focus. It also helps with keeping your browser updated as time progresses as well, making the website less faulty. Progressive Enhancement allows for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to run smoothly together, making it easier to update and modify the website. Understanding this allows for the user to be competent and knowledgeable of the graceful degradation and the idea of layering in web development. It also helps with the site's load time too if the site is regularly updated.

<h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
      <p>My sister told me that I needed to put more thought and effort into the project, but she liked how the project was cohesive. The project took a while to get the hang of as I had to go back to the old sessions to learn how to incorporate the correct instruments for my project. For the semester I felt like I should've been more interactive during the class sessions as some of my other peers. I enjoyed the class as it taught me how websites work. I remember seeing the stylesheet for the UALR page and I was very intrigued. I would also make sure that I have a better understanding off how to push my work as I had trouble remembering the process. I would also try to go to the class in person more as the live sessions were good, but I feel that I would've been more attentive as well. The extra credit assignments that were provided also allowed me to become more knowledgeable about the content that was being discussed. I believe that the readings were more prone to being misinterpreted or forgetten even though they were good for the most part. I enjoyed learning about how to incorporate the different colors into my own work as well. I never knew that certain letters and numbers corresponded to a individual color.
